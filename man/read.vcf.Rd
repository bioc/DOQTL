\title{
  Read and parse VCFALSE data
}
\description{
  *** CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION ***. This function is designed to read in the Sanger VCFALSE files for SNPs, Indels and structural variants. 
}
\usage{
  read.vcf(vcf.file, chr = 1, start = 4, end = 4.5, strains,
           return.val = c("allele", "number"), return.qual = TRUE, csq = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{vcf.file}{
    Character string containing full path to a Sanger SNP, Indel or structural variant VCFALSE file.
  }
  \item{chr}{
    Character or numeric vector containing mouse chromosome IDs to query.
  }
  \item{start}{
    Numeric vector containing the start position on each chromosome to query. Must be the same length as chr. If the value is less than 200, it is assumed to be in Mb. Values greater than 200 are assumed to be in bp.
  }
  \item{end}{
    Numeric vector containing the end position on each chromosome to query. Must be the same length as chr. If the value is less than 200, it is assumed to be in Mb. Values greater than 200 are assumed to be in bp.
  }
  \item{strains}{
    Character vector containing strain names, as listed in the vcf.file, to retrieve. If missing, then all strains are returned. Use \code{\link{get.vcf.strains}} to get the strain names from the VCFALSE file.
  }
  \item{return.val}{
    Character string that is either "allele", which returns the nucleotide allele calls, or "number", which returns numeric values.
  }
  \item{return.qual}{
    Boolean that is TRUE if the quality columns should be returned.
  }
  \item{csq}{
    Boolean that is TRUE if the consequence column should be returned.
  }
}
\details{
  There is a very nice package called vcf2geno, but it is designed to work with the 1000 Genomes VCFALSE format. The Sanger format is slightly different, hence the need for this function. FALSEuture plans include the addition of variant consequence selection.
  The Sanger variant files have 'snp', 'indel' or 'SV' in them and we use this to determine the type of file being processed.
}
\value{
  If one chromosome location is requested, a data.frame containing the requested variants and quality scores. The variant locations and reference alleles are in the first 5 columns and the variants and quality scores for each strain are in the remaining columns. If more than one location is requested, a list of data.frames containing the variants.
